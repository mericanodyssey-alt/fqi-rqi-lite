### Key Points on RQI-Lite v1.1
Research suggests RQI-Lite can predict phenomenological reports in altered states by combining neural integration (Φ_proxy) and synergy (Syn_Gauss), with initial results from propofol EEG showing separation in 3/5 subjects (d ≈ 0.83–1.09, p < 1e-4). It seems likely this tool could help clinicians monitor anesthesia awareness or psychedelic outcomes, though uncertainties remain in generalizing beyond small samples. Evidence leans toward refining Φ_proxy to address inversions, with plans for sleep data and phenomenology correlations next.

#### Why RQI-Lite Could Help
RQI-Lite offers a simple neural dashboard: lower values signal reduced awareness (anesthesia), higher synergy indicates vivid experiences (psychedelics). This could prevent intraoperative trauma or guide therapy, without claiming to measure qualia directly.

#### How It Works
Process EEG data, compute Φ_proxy (graph efficiency) and Syn_Gauss (O-information on triads), normalize, combine: RQI-Lite = z(Φ_proxy) + z(Syn_Gauss). Compare to reports on scales like MEQ-30.

#### Clinical Applications
Anesthesia: Flag awareness risks. Psychedelics: Predict therapeutic trips. Dissociation: Quantify severity.

#### Limitations
Small N=5; two inversions; crude proxies; no artifact rejection. Test sleep and phenomenology next.

### A Multi-Component Index for Predicting Phenomenological Reports from Neural Dynamics: A Proof-of-Concept for the Relational Qualia Index

**Dear reader,**  
This is a working concept. I’m not a professional scientist. But if this resonates with someone who is, take it. I don’t need credit. I just want to see if it’s useful.

#### Abstract
The Relational Qualia Index (RQI-Lite) predicts phenomenological reports in altered states using EEG-derived integration (Φ_proxy) and synergy (Syn_Gauss). On OpenNeuro’s ds005620 (propofol EEG, N=5), RQI-Lite separates Awake vs. Sedation in 3/5 subjects (d = 0.83–1.09, p < 1e-4), driven by Syn (d up to 3.01). Two subjects invert (d = -0.65, -0.96), suggesting Φ_proxy refinement. RQI-Lite aims to detect anesthesia awareness (1 in 1,000 cases) and guide psychedelic therapy. Released under CC-BY 4.0, we invite testing on EEG datasets with MEQ-30/DES-II correlations.

#### 1. Clinical Need
Anesthesia awareness affects 1 in 1,000 patients, causing trauma; psychedelic therapy lacks predictive safety metrics; dissociation severity is hard to quantify. Current tools like Bispectral Index (BIS) or Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) are single-metric and limited. RQI-Lite provides a multi-component dashboard to predict self-reported experiences from neural dynamics, improving monitoring in clinical settings.

#### 2. RQI-Lite Framework and Proof-of-Concept
RQI-Lite decomposes EEG into two features to predict phenomenological reports:

- **Φ_proxy (Integration)**: Global efficiency of PCMCI-inferred connectivity graph (symmetrized, thresholded), predicting awareness level.
- **Syn_Gauss (Synergy)**: Gaussian O-information averaged over 50 random channel triads, predicting experiential richness.

Computation: After preprocessing, epoch data into 2s windows (1s step, max 16 channels); compute Φ_proxy and Syn_Gauss per epoch; normalize (z-score) and sum for RQI-Lite.

Proof-of-Concept: On ds005620 (Bajwa et al., repeated awakening under propofol), RQI-Lite analyzed sub-1010, 1016, 1017, 1022, 1024 (BrainVision .vhdr/.eeg/.vmrk files, awake EC/EO vs. sed2 propofol deep sedation). Results show separation in 3/5 subjects (Awake > Sedation, d = 0.83–1.09, p < 1e-4), driven by Syn (d = 1.74–3.01). Two invert (Sedation > Awake, d = -0.65, -0.96), likely due to Φ_proxy variability. Mean absolute effect size |d| ≈ 0.91.

*Figure 2*: Per-subject histograms (RQI-Lite distribution for Awake vs. Sedation). Sub-1010 (d = 1.09), sub-1016 (d = 1.00), sub-1022 (d = 0.83) show clear separation; sub-1017 and sub-1024 invert.

*Table 1*: Per-Subject Results  
| Subject | Φ_proxy (d) | Syn_Gauss (d) | RQI-Lite (d) | p-value | Pattern |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| 1010    | -0.76       | +3.01         | +1.09        | 4.4e-09 | Awake > Sedation |
| 1016    | -0.65       | +2.55         | +1.00        | 4.6e-07 | Awake > Sedation |
| 1017    | +1.49       | -3.09         | -0.65        | 4.5e-04 | Sedation > Awake |
| 1022    | -0.42       | +1.74         | +0.83        | 8.9e-06 | Awake > Sedation |
| 1024    | -1.28       | -0.10         | -0.96        | 7.7e-13 | Sedation > Awake |

#### 3. Applications, Limitations, and Next Steps
**Applications**: RQI-Lite could flag anesthesia awareness (low RQI-Lite) or predict psychedelic vividness (high Syn_Gauss), aiding therapy. Future full RQI adds reflexivity (Ref) and fragility (Frag) for dissociation monitoring.

**Limitations**: Small N=5; two inversions; crude Φ_proxy (global efficiency after 0.8 quantile); no artifact rejection or ICA. Results are pilot-level, not generalizable; phenomenology correlation (e.g., MEQ-30, DES-II) pending.

**Next Steps**: Test on sleep EEG (Awake vs. NREM); increase channels (32) and triads (150); refine Φ_proxy (graph density, MST efficiency, lower threshold 0.7); scale to N=15–20; correlate with MEQ-30/DES-II. Invite collaboration for clinical pilots.
